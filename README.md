DESCRIPTION:
This project is a front-end user interface design for a modern e-learning platform, developed as part of my internship assignment. The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly interface that represents how an online learning platform could function in the real world. The application focuses on presenting courses, learning previews, and user navigation in a clean and intuitive way using only HTML and CSS.

The design follows a warm brown and beige theme, giving the platform a soft, comfortable, and premium feel that is easy on the eyes. This color palette was chosen to make the platform look welcoming and professional at the same time, creating an environment where users can feel relaxed while learning. The theme also helps differentiate the platform from typical dark or bright educational websites, giving it a unique identity.

The platform includes a home section that introduces the purpose of the website and encourages users to explore available courses. A navigation bar is provided at the top of the page, allowing users to easily move between sections such as Home, Courses, About, and Contact. Although this is a front-end-only project, the layout is structured in a way that it can be easily connected to a backend in the future.

One of the main highlights of the project is the Featured Courses section. This section displays multiple course cards in a clean grid layout. Each course card includes a category label, course title, short description, price displayed in euros (€), and a star rating. The prices in euros were intentionally used to give the platform an international and professional feel. The cards are designed to be visually attractive while still being easy to read and understand, making it simple for users to compare courses.

The platform also includes a Sample Learning Video section, which demonstrates how a video lesson preview would appear in a real e-learning application. Instead of using a live embedded video (which can sometimes cause technical or embedding issues), a custom video preview card with a thumbnail and play button was implemented. This approach ensures that the UI always looks clean and functional while still representing the idea of video-based learning. This is especially useful for showcasing UI design skills in an internship project.

Another important part of the project is the “How It Works” section. This section visually explains the learning flow in three simple steps:

1. Choose a Course

2. Watch and Practice

3. Get Certified

These steps are displayed in large, easy-to-understand cards, helping users quickly grasp how the platform works. This improves the user experience and makes the website feel more structured and purposeful.

The entire interface was built with a strong focus on responsiveness. The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, making it usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This is essential for modern web applications, especially for learning platforms where users often access content from multiple devices.

From a technical perspective, this project uses HTML to structure the content and CSS to handle layout, colors, spacing, typography, and responsiveness. Care was taken to keep the code clean and organized, with reusable classes and well-structured sections that make future expansion easy. While no JavaScript is used in this version, the UI is designed in a way that interactive features such as user accounts, course progress tracking, and video playback could be added later.

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to design and structure a complete front-end interface for a real-world application. It shows skills in layout design, visual consistency, user experience, and responsive web design. As an internship task, it reflects both creativity and technical understanding, making it a strong example of how a modern e-learning platform could be visually presented.
